# Invite
User should be able to invite multiple users - textarea with comma seperated values
    - check if the email adress is already an entry in users table
    - even if not active, invite should not go

Email will be sent to each user to register - token based links
    - link should expire (after a configured amount of time)

User should also see a list of invites he has sent and that are still active
    - if a user gets an invite, but later registers without invite then change the status
